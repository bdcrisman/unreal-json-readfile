# unreal-json-readfile

## summary
* Quick demo of how to deserialize json into structs. 

## description
* Coming from Unity, Unreal is pretty different. C# makes it super simple to parse most files while C++ is pretty manual, plus blueprints are kind-of a pain at first. Much of my work depends on reading json files so going through several tutorials and combining ideas/suggestions I was finally able to get over this hurdle. 
* At the time of pushing, I was using vscode so for code warnings/errors, I had to add defines to the ```.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json``` file, which you can find here <https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/5GuRLyP1QtGXtVRTS6Cp>

## dependencies
* Unreal 4.26
